I'm a Mechanical Engineer with a Ph.D. in Computational Fluid Dynamics. Over the past few years, I've become interested in algorithmic trading and I'm currently developing my own trading system and algorithms using Python.

I'm also obsessed with rock climbing and when I'm not working you'll probably find me hanging from a steep cliff somewhere...
